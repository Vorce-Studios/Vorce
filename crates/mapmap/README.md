# MapFlow (Application)

The main entry point and binary crate for the MapFlow projection mapping suite.

## Overview

This crate glues together all the specialized crates (`mapmap-core`, `mapmap-render`, `mapmap-ui`, etc.) to form the complete application.
It initializes the engine, sets up the windowing system, and runs the main event loop.

## Documentation

Full project documentation is available in the [`docs/`](../../docs/) directory.

## Running MapFlow

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary system dependencies installed (see root README).

cargo run --release

# Run with FFmpeg support (video playback)
cargo run --release --features ffmpeg

# Run with full audio support
cargo run --release --features ffmpeg,audio
```

## Configuration

MapFlow stores user configuration (window positions, last used audio device, etc.) in the system's user data directory:
