# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the MapFlow project, implementing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with Jules AI integration.

## 🤖 Workflows Overview

### 1. CICD-DevFlow: Job01 Validation (`CICD-DevFlow_Job01_Validation.yml`) ⚡ OPTIMIZED

**Purpose:** Comprehensive continuous integration and deployment pipeline

**Triggers:**

- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual dispatch

> [!TIP]
> **Optimization:** Parallel jobs reduce runtime by ~30-50%

**Jobs (PARALLEL execution after pre-checks):**

- **Pre-Checks:** Auto-formatting and Clippy fixes
- **Code Quality:** Linting and dependency checks (parallel)
- **Build & Test:** Linux builds with audio (parallel)
- **Windows Build:** Optional - only on `main` or with `test-windows` label
- **Security Audit:** cargo-audit and dependency review (parallel)
- **Success Gate:** Ensures all checks pass before merge

### 2. CodeQL Security Scan (`CI-02_security-scan.yml`) ⚡ OPTIMIZED

**Purpose:** Automated security vulnerability detection

**Triggers:**

- Push to `main` branch (with path filters)
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 00:00 UTC)
- Manual dispatch

> [!TIP]
> **Optimization:** Removed PR trigger - CodeQL is slow and not needed for every PR.
> Fast security checks (cargo-audit) are in CI-01 for PRs.

### 3. Create Jules Development Issues (`CI-03_create-issues.yml`)

**Purpose:** Create all Jules development issues at once

**Triggers:**

- Manual dispatch only (run once to create all issues)

**Features:**

- Creates all development tasks from ROADMAP.md as GitHub issues
- Properly labeled with `jules-task` for Jules to process
- Includes priority labels and phase information
- Prevents duplicate creation
- Simple one-time setup

**Usage:**

```bash
# Create all Jules issues (run once)
gh workflow run CI-03_create-issues.yml
```

**Note:** This should be run ONCE to create all initial issues. Issues are pre-defined in the workflow, not parsed from ROADMAP.md (simpler and more reliable).

### 4. Jules Session Trigger (`CI-04_session-trigger.yml`) 🆕

**Purpose:** Automatically trigger Jules sessions when issues are created or labeled

**Triggers:**

- Issue opened with `jules-task` label
- `jules-task` label added to existing issue
- Manual dispatch (single issue)

**Features:**

- **Automatic Detection:** Monitors all issues with `jules-task` label
- **Official Jules Action:** Uses `google-labs-code/jules-action@v1` for reliable session creation
- **Tracking Comments:** Adds status comments to issues
- **Flexible Setup:** Works with or without API key (supports Jules GitHub App)

**Usage:**

```bash
# Automatically triggered when issue gets jules-task label

# Or manually trigger for specific issue:
gh workflow run CI-04_session-trigger.yml -f issue_number=123
```

**Configuration:**

- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Install Jules GitHub App at <https://github.com/apps/jules>
  - No API key needed
  - Works automatically with all `jules-task` issues
- **Option 2:** Add `JULES_API_KEY` as repository secret for GitHub Action-based automation
  - Get API key from <https://jules.google.com> (Settings)
  - Workflow uses official `google-labs-code/jules-action`
- **Fallback:** Manual session creation via jules.google.com

**What it does:**

1. Detects issues with `jules-task` label
2. Extracts issue details (number, title, body)
3. Adds tracking comment to issue
4. If `JULES_API_KEY` is configured:
   - Uses `google-labs-code/jules-action@v1` to create Jules session
   - Passes issue content as prompt
   - Jules creates branch, implements changes, opens PR
5. Updates issue with success/failure status
6. If no API key:
   - Still adds tracking comment
   - Jules GitHub App takes over (if installed)

### 5. CICD-DevFlow: Job02 Auto-Merge (`CICD-DevFlow_Job02_AutoMerge.yml`) ✨ Enhanced

**Purpose:** Automatically merge Jules PRs when all checks pass, with intelligent error handling

**Triggers:**

- Pull request events (opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled)
- Check suite completion
- Workflow run completion (CICD-DevFlow: Job01 Validation)
- Manual dispatch

**Features:**

- **Intelligent Check Monitoring:** Waits for all checks to complete
- **Success Path:** Auto-merges when all checks pass
- **Error Path:** Creates detailed @jules comments with failure information
- **Merge Conflict Detection:** Notifies about conflicts
- **Failed Check Details:** Includes check names, summaries, and links
- **Retry Support:** Jules can update PR, checks re-run automatically

**Auto-Merge Conditions:**

1. ✅ PR labeled with `jules-pr` or body contains "Created by Jules"
2. ✅ All CI checks pass (except auto-merge workflow itself)
3. ✅ No merge conflicts
4. ✅ No review requested changes
5. ✅ Not a draft PR

**Error Handling:**

- Detects failed checks and collects details
- Creates @jules comment with:
  - List of failed checks
  - Error summaries
  - Links to detailed logs
- Allows Jules to fix and re-submit

### 6. Update Documentation (`CI-06_update-changelog.yml`)

**Purpose:** Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date automatically

**Triggers:**

- Pull request closed/merged

**Features:**

- Simple changelog updates
- Adds entry for each merged PR
- Commits changes automatically
- No complex parsing or updates - just adds changelog entries!

### 7. Post-Merge Automation (`CI-07_post-merge-automation.yml`) 🆕

**Purpose:** Complete post-merge tasks: close issue, update ROADMAP, trigger next session

**Triggers:**

- Pull request closed/merged (Jules PRs only)
- Manual dispatch

**Features:**

- **Issue Management:** Automatically closes related issue
- **ROADMAP Updates:** Marks tasks as completed
- **Continuous Automation:** Triggers CI-04 for next jules-task issue
- **Progress Tracking:** Adds completion comments

**Workflow:**

1. Extract issue number from PR body
2. Close related issue with success comment
3. Update ROADMAP.md:
   - Mark task as completed
   - Add PR reference
   - Commit changes
4. Trigger CI-04 for next oldest jules-task issue

### 8. Monitor Jules Session (`CI-08_monitor-jules-session.yml`) ⚡ OPTIMIZED

**Purpose:** Event-based monitoring of Jules sessions (no continuous polling)

**Triggers:**

- `workflow_call` from CI-04 (when session starts)
- `push` to `jules-*` branches (when Jules creates PR branch)
- Manual `workflow_dispatch`

> [!TIP]
> **Optimization:** Changed from continuous 6-hour polling to event-based triggers.
> **Savings:** ~2000+ minutes/week

**Features:**

- **Single-Run Check:** Runs once per trigger, no polling loop
- **Active Session Detection:** Finds sessions from issue comments
- **Automatic PR Creation:** Creates PR when session completes
- **Label Management:** Adds jules-pr label automatically
- **Timeout:** 30 minutes (reduced from 360)

**Workflow:**

1. Triggered by CI-04, branch push, or manual dispatch
2. Find all open jules-task issues
3. Check Jules API for each session (single check)
4. When session completes:
   - Create PR with proper labels
   - Add success comment to issue
5. Exit (no re-trigger)

## 🏷️ Labels Used

The automation system uses the following labels:

- `jules-task`: Issues that can be processed by Jules

### Configuration

To enable Jules integration:

1. Ensure Jules has access to the repository
2. Configure Jules to use the `development_task.yml` issue template
3. Set Jules to label PRs with `jules-pr`
4. Configure branch protection rules (recommended):
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require review from code owners (optional)
   - Require branches to be up to date

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status

```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Watch a run in real-time
gh run watch <run-id>
```

### Trigger Workflows Manually

```bash
# Trigger CI/CD pipeline
gh workflow run "CI/CD Pipeline"

# Create issues from roadmap (dry run)
gh workflow run auto-create-issues.yml -f dry_run=true

# Trigger documentation update
gh workflow run CI-06_update-changelog.yml
```

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Adding New Workflows

1. Create `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Define triggers and jobs
3. Test with manual dispatch first
4. Update this README

### Modifying Existing Workflows

1. Test changes in a feature branch
2. Use workflow dispatch for testing
3. Monitor logs carefully
4. Update documentation

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: CI fails with dependency errors**

- Check system dependencies in `CI-01_build-and-test.yml`
- Verify FFmpeg installation
- Check package availability on runner OS

**Issue: Auto-merge not working**

- Verify PR has `jules-pr` label
- Check all required checks pass
- Ensure no merge conflicts
- Review branch protection rules

**Issue: Issues not created from ROADMAP**
