  **MapFlow** is a next-generation, modular **VJ (Video Jockey) Software**
  engineered for high-performance visual synthesis, real-time effects, and
  professional projection mapping. Built with the speed and safety of **Rust**,
  it empowers artists to create immersive visual experiences with unprecedented
  flexibility.

## 🚀 Vision

In an era of complex visual performances, MapFlow bridges the gap between ease
of use and professional power. By utilizing a **node-based architecture**,
every parameter becomes a playground for automation, audio-reactivity, and
external control.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧩 Modular Node System

Design complex visual flows by connecting video sources, generative shaders, and
real-time filters. Every node property is a control target for our unified
modulation system.

### ⚡ Professional Rendering Engine

Powered by **WGPU** and the **Bevy Engine**, MapFlow delivers low-latency, hardware-accelerated rendering.

* **Multi-Layer Composition**: Advanced blend modes and hierarchical grouping.
* **3D & Particle Integration**: Native Bevy support for stunning volumetric effects and 3D scenes.
* **LUT Color Grading**: Industry-standard `.cube` support for cinematic looks.

### 🔊 Deep Audio Reactivity

Our **AudioAnalyzer V2** tracks 9 frequency bands, RMS volume, and peak detection in real-time, allowing visuals to dance perfectly to the beat.

### 📐 Precision Projection Mapping

* **Bezier Warping**: Flexible mesh deformation for complex surfaces.
* **Edge Blending**: Seamless multi-projector setups with per-output gamma correction.
* **Advanced Masking**: Integrated shape and file-based masking tools.

### 🎛️ Unified Control

Seamlessly integrate with your performance setup via **OSC**, **MIDI**, and
**Ableton Link**. Our built-in **Jules AI assistant** is always ready to help
you extend the software's capabilities.
