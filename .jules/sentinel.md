## 2026-01-02 - Missing CSP on API/WS Server
**Vulnerability:** The web server component in `mapmap-control` (serving API and WebSocket) was missing a `Content-Security-Policy` header. While primarily an API server, the absence of CSP meant that if a browser were to render a response as HTML (e.g., via a misconfigured error page or direct navigation), it could execute arbitrary scripts.
**Learning:** Even API-centric servers should enforce CSP. `default-src 'none'` is a robust default for APIs that prevents any unauthorized resource loading or script execution, providing a strong defense-in-depth layer against potential XSS vectors.
**Prevention:** Always include `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';` for API servers. Use `security_headers` middleware to enforce this globally.

## 2026-01-23 - Insecure Default Bind Address
**Vulnerability:** The web server defaulted to binding to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces), exposing the unauthenticated control API to the local network (and potentially public internet) without user awareness.
**Learning:** Secure defaults are critical. Development conveniences (like "it just works from my phone") should never compromise security. Users must explicitly opt-in to network exposure.
**Prevention:** Always default server bind addresses to `127.0.0.1`. Update `Default` trait implementations for configuration structs to reflect this.

## 2026-01-26 - Plaintext API Keys in Config
**Vulnerability:** API keys were stored in plain text within the `AuthConfig` struct and serialized to configuration files. This exposed credentials to anyone with read access to the config or memory dumps.
**Learning:** Configuration structs are often serialized directly. Adding security layers (like hashing) requires careful handling of serialization to maintain backward compatibility with legacy plaintext data. A custom deserializer can intelligently migrate legacy data.
**Prevention:** Use SHA-256 hashing for storage of all secrets. Implement `deserialize_with` for `serde` to handle the migration from plaintext to hash transparently on load.

## 2026-05-24 - Path Traversal in MCP Server
**Vulnerability:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server allowed `project_save` and `project_load` commands to access arbitrary file paths (e.g., `../evil.txt`), potentially allowing an automated agent (or attacker) to overwrite sensitive system files or exfiltrate data.
**Learning:** Agent interfaces that expose file system operations must be sandboxed. Standard `PathBuf` handling does not automatically prevent traversal (`..`).
**Prevention:** Explicitly validate all user-supplied paths in agent tools. Reject paths containing `ParentDir` (`..`) components and enforce relative paths or specific sandboxed roots.

## 2026-10-24 - Insecure Logic for Empty Allowed Origins
**Vulnerability:** The web server treated an empty list of `allowed_origins` as "Allow All" (wildcard), intended as a permissive default. This meant that configurations intending to restrict access (by providing an empty list) inadvertently opened the API to all origins.
**Learning:** "Empty means None" is the standard semantic expectation for security allowlists. "Empty means All" is a dangerous anti-pattern that leads to accidental exposure.
**Prevention:** Treat empty allowlists as "Deny All". Require explicit `*` or `Any` markers for permissive modes. Ensure secure defaults (empty/deny) in configuration structs.

## 2026-10-25 - Missing File Extension Validation in MCP
**Vulnerability:** The MCP server's file operations (`project_save`, `project_load`) blocked path traversal but allowed arbitrary file extensions. This could allow an agent to overwrite sensitive system files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.env`) if they resided in the working directory.
**Learning:** Preventing path traversal (`..`) is insufficient for file security. Restricting file types by extension is a critical second layer of defense (defense-in-depth) to prevent malicious file creation or loading.
**Prevention:** Use `validate_path_with_extensions` helper for all file-based MCP tools, enforcing a strict whitelist of allowed extensions (e.g., `["mapmap", "json"]`).

## 2026-10-26 - Missing Input Validation in WebSocket Handler
**Vulnerability:** The WebSocket message handler (`handle_text_message`) deserialized JSON into strictly typed structs (`ControlTarget`, `ControlValue`) but failed to invoke their defined `.validate()` methods. This allowed malicious payloads (e.g., infinite strings, invalid control characters) to bypass the validation logic intended by the type definitions.
**Learning:** Defining validation logic on a type is not enough; it must be explicitly invoked at the IO boundary. Serde deserialization handles structure but not semantic validity (lengths, ranges, content rules).
**Prevention:** Always pair `serde::from_str` with explicit validation calls (`.validate()`) immediately after deserialization at the system boundary. Enforce this pattern in all request handlers.

## 2026-01-04 - Unsafe Buffer Over-read in VAAPI Format Negotiation
**Vulnerability:** The `get_vaapi_format` C-callback function in `crates/mapmap-media/src/decoder.rs` iterated over a raw `AVPixelFormat` pointer assuming a null-terminated list. If the `ffmpeg` library or a malicious caller provided a non-terminated list, this would result in a buffer over-read (OOB access), potentially crashing the application or exposing memory.
**Learning:** `unsafe` code interacting with C-APIs must be strictly defensive. We cannot assume the contract of the external library is always upheld, especially when the iteration count is unbounded.
**Prevention:** Always impose a sane upper limit (e.g., `MAX_FORMATS`) on unbounded loops over raw pointers and check for null pointers before access. This ensures that even if the external data is malformed, the application remains stable.

## 2026-10-27 - Unbounded Resource Consumption in Image Sequence Loader
**Vulnerability:** The `ImageSequenceDecoder` iterated over all files in a user-provided directory without limit. A directory with millions of files would cause the application to hang or crash (OOM), acting as a local Denial of Service vector.
**Learning:** Iterators over external resources (like file systems) must always be bounded. "Users won't do that" is not a valid defense against accidental or malicious inputs.
**Prevention:** Implement explicit `MAX_ITEMS` limits on all directory scanning or collection loops. Use `cfg(test)` to lower these limits for efficient unit testing.

## 2026-10-28 - Browser WebSocket Authentication Bypass
**Vulnerability:** Browser-based WebSocket clients could not authenticate with the API server because the `extract_api_key` logic relied on standard HTTP headers (`Authorization`, `X-API-Key`) which browsers cannot set for WebSocket connections. This forced developers to potentially disable authentication for WebSocket endpoints.
**Learning:** Browser WebSocket APIs are restrictive. Authentication tokens must be transmitted via the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header (subprotocol negotiation) as a standard workaround.
**Prevention:** Always support `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` parsing in API key extraction logic for WebSocket endpoints. Implement specific parsing for custom subprotocol formats (e.g., `mapmap.auth.<TOKEN>`).
## 2026-10-31 - WebSocket DoS and Compliance Fixes
**Vulnerability:** The WebSocket handler in `mapmap-control` allowed unlimited message sizes (defaulting to underlying library limits which can be large), exposing the server to Memory Exhaustion DoS. Additionally, the server sent `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) headers over plain HTTP, violating RFC 6797 and potentially causing availability issues for local development.
**Learning:** Application-level limits are often applied too late (after full message buffering). Proper resource limits must be configured at the protocol/transport layer (e.g., `max_message_size` in the WebSocket upgrade handshake). Security headers like HSTS must be context-aware; sending them blindly on insecure transports is harmful.
**Prevention:** Configure `max_message_size` on all WebSocket endpoints. Remove HSTS from plain HTTP servers and rely on TLS termination proxies to handle strict transport security.

## 2026-10-31 - Insufficient Validation of Custom Targets
**Vulnerability:** `ControlTarget::Custom` allowed arbitrary strings including path traversal characters (`/`, `..`, `\`). While no direct exploit was found, this permissive validation could lead to injection or path traversal vulnerabilities if these strings are ever used in file system or command contexts.
**Learning:** Input validation must be restrictive by default. "Custom" does not mean "Unsafe". Even internal identifiers should be validated against a strict character set (e.g., alphanumeric) to prevent future misuse.
**Prevention:** Enforce strict validation (disallow control chars, path separators) on all user-supplied identifiers at the type level (`validate()` method).

## 2026-02-13 - [Sensitive Data Caching]
**Vulnerability:** API responses containing sensitive system status and configuration were potentially cacheable by intermediaries and browsers because `Cache-Control` headers were missing.
**Learning:** Default `security_headers` middleware in Axum does not automatically prevent caching. Explicit `no-store` is required for control interfaces exposing sensitive data.
**Prevention:** Always add `Cache-Control: no-store, max-age=0` and `Pragma: no-cache` to the security headers middleware for authenticated API routes.

## 2026-02-14 - Project File DoS Vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** The project loading mechanism (`ProjectFile::load`) in `mapmap-io` read the entire file content into memory without checking its size first. A malicious actor could provide a massive file (e.g., 10GB of zeroes), causing the application to crash due to memory exhaustion (OOM).
**Learning:** Reading entire files into memory (`read_to_string`) is dangerous without explicit limits. `File::metadata()` provides a quick check, but a race condition (TOCTOU) could allow the file to grow between check and read.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a hard limit on file size (`MAX_PROJECT_FILE_SIZE`). Use `file.metadata()?.len()` for a fast check, and `file.take(LIMIT).read_to_string()` for a robust, race-condition-safe read.

## 2026-02-23 - OSC Server Memory Exhaustion DoS
**Vulnerability:** The OSC server used an unbounded `std::sync::mpsc::channel`, allowing an attacker to flood the server with packets faster than it could process them, leading to unbounded memory growth and eventual crash (OOM).
**Learning:** Default channels in Rust are often unbounded. Network-facing components must always apply backpressure to the transport layer (e.g., blocking the receive loop) to prevent resource exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Use `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel(MAX_PENDING_PACKETS)` with a reasonable bound (e.g., 1024) to enforce backpressure.
